 puts "You wake up in the middle of the night, and it's pitch black. You see nothing a pair of white eyes in the corner. You don't know where you are, you can’t see anything, you’re confused and scared like a little baby. The pair of white eyes slowly move towards you and you can hear the floorboard creaking."
